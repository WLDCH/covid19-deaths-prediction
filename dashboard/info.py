# COVID-19 deaths prediction dashboard
CHRIMNI Walid

[Project Repo](https://github.com/WLDCH/covid19-deaths-prediction)

I made this dashboard as a part of my MLOps Zoomcamp final project.

The dashboard shows the number of deaths per day due to COVID-19 so far and a prediction of deaths for the next two weeks.

The data is retrieved and updated every day via data.gouv.fr. The dashboard is updated when you click on "Update" (if any new data is available)

note = """
The model is retrained every monday at 20h00. Three differents type of Deep Learning model are trained (TCN, RNN and Transformer)
and the best one is choosen each week.
